An audio visualizer using Processing. This visualizes audio from default audio input of the computer. So in default state it will visualize the audio input from the **microphone**. 

But alternatively default audio input of the computer can be changed to audio monitor. In that case this will visualize the **audio output** of your computer. (literally what you hear from your computer - currently playing song, youtube video etc.)

In a **Ubuntu** system, default audio input can be changed to audio monitor using 'PulseAudio Volume Control'

In a **Windows** system, default audio input can be changed to audio monitor by going through system settings (or Control Panel in older versions)

Looking foward to include switching between microphone and audio monitor to application itself :)
